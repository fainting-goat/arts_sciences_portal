Category.create(name: 'Lapidary', division: studio, description: "This category is for entries made from gemstones or crystals. Lapidary judges should keep in mind that primary sources for this category consist mainly of museum pieces and a few treatises, such as Albert Magnus and Theophilus. \n\rThe following techniques are typical to period stones and should be treated as examples of authentic methods when judging authenticity:\n\rPolished nicks in stones were the result of cutting out a flaw while removing as little material and weight as possible.\n\rStones which have been polished or faceted following the original shape so as to lose as little weight as possible.\n\rDrilled stones.\n\rCrystals, especially low-grade emeralds, drilled lengthwise and polished but not substantially shaped.\n\rCabochons which started out as drilled stones, then were cut in half, leaving a line across the back of the stone where the hole was.\n\rModern standards for gemstone polish require a smooth, mirror-like finish without visible scratches. Period lapidaries did not have the benefit of precision equipment or fine, uniform abrasives, so that small scratches and slightly milky finishes are common in examples of period lapidary. When judging mastery of polishing technique, judges should consider the nature of the technique and polishing equipment used; entries using both modern equipment and abrasives should be judged according to a modern standard, while entries using either period equipment or period abrasives should be judged according to the standards for the appropriate period.\n\rAbout Materials\n\rWhile use of natural materials is encouraged, extreme cost and tightly controlled distribution of certain types of natural gem rough may make their use in entries impossible. In these cases, synthetic stones are preferred, followed then by simulated stones. Synthetic gem rough is defined as a material that is effectively identical in chemical formulation to the natural gem. It has the same optical and physical properties, is just as hard to shape and polish, but was grown in a lab. Synthetic gem rough will be considered a fully authentic, period material for the purposes of judging.\n\rScoring Qualifiers\n\rSimulated gem rough is defined as lab-created material which is not chemically identical to the natural gemstone, and does not necessarily have the same physical or optical properties. Although simulated gem rough is not an authentic material, entries made from it should only be penalized .5 point for Methods and Materials. The hardness portion of the Scope score should be based on the hardness of the simulant, not the natural stone. Cubic zirconium (CZ) is slightly less hard than corundum, but still much harder than garnet, and substantially harder than quartz. Yttrium aluminate (YAG), a garnet simulant, is slightly harder than garnet. A stone cut from YAG will score .5 point lower in Methods and Materials than an identical stone cut from natural garnet, but will score .5 point higher in hardness for Scope.")

Drawings of the artisan's intent (or photographs of a period piece), if included, will help to show the original intent and compare it to the execution. For scores in Documentation and Methods and Materials, consideration can be given to entries that may logically have existed either as a derivative (e.g., from a wood or cloth item) or there is evidence of similar articles before and after the time of the article, so it is logical that the piece existed in some form within period.

Category.create(name: 'Wood Embellishment', division: technical, description: "This category is for the decoration and embellishment of wooden items, not their construction, and covers techniques such as inlay, veneer, marquetry, incised carving, low-relief carving, chip carving, burned decoration, gesso and modeled gesso, metal foils, turnings, etc. As availability of lumber types in the Middle Kingdom does not match those available to our honorable ancestors, it is likely that the entrant will have to make substitutions and it will be incumbent upon them to explain these choices. Any unusual techniques or materials should be explained in the documentation. ")
Category.create(name: 'Wood Turning', division: technical, description: "This category is for wooden items turned on a lathe. As availability of lumber types in the Middle Kingdom does not match those available to our honorable ancestors, it is likely that the entrant will have to make substitutions and it will be incumbent upon them to explain these choices.

Category.create(name: 'Knitting Nailbinding', division: textile, description: "This category encompasses non-woven work done with thread or yarn and at least one needle.\n\rExamples include stockings, hats, shirts, gloves, and carpets. Nålbinding is a single-needle knitting technique known in Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Coptic cultures in period. \n\rUse of period materials encouraged, but if the entrant cannot use period materials or methods for allergy or other medical reasons and documents those reasons in the documentation, he/she should not be penalized. If using a hand-spun, hand-dyed yarn, it does not need to be spun/dyed by the entrant.")
Category.create(name: 'Bookbinding', division: studio, description: "The working definition of a book for the category is pages joined together with sewing, tackets, rings, thread, paste, or any combination thereof. It does not include calligraphy and/or illumination as those have their own categories and are not integral to the binding process. This category concerns the method used to join the pages together. It is recommended that if the book is fully covered in leather, cloth, or paper, that the entrant provide good clear photographs of any binding structures that are covered up and hidden by the covering material.  \n\rThe working of the covering material, be it leather, cloth, wood, or paper, should only be judged based on the actual structural integrity of the work in relation to the binding, or as is the case with leather, the attachment method to the binding and/or boards and style of the corners. No decorative elements such as leather tooling, embroidery, dyeing, decorative metalwork (not including metal corners for wear and tear or clasps), or lapidary should be considered, unless they are part of the binding structure.")
Category.create(name: 'Glasswork Lampwork Beads', division: studio, description: "This category includes all lampwork beads, made on a torch or in a period furnace. Substitution of materials because of prohibitive cost or unsuitability should be explained in the documentation and should not be counted against the entrant.")
