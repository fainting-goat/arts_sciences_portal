Category.create(name: 'Lapidary', division: studio, description: "This category is for entries made from gemstones or crystals. Lapidary judges should keep in mind that primary sources for this category consist mainly of museum pieces and a few treatises, such as Albert Magnus and Theophilus. \n\rThe following techniques are typical to period stones and should be treated as examples of authentic methods when judging authenticity:\n\rPolished nicks in stones were the result of cutting out a flaw while removing as little material and weight as possible.\n\rStones which have been polished or faceted following the original shape so as to lose as little weight as possible.\n\rDrilled stones.\n\rCrystals, especially low-grade emeralds, drilled lengthwise and polished but not substantially shaped.\n\rCabochons which started out as drilled stones, then were cut in half, leaving a line across the back of the stone where the hole was.\n\rModern standards for gemstone polish require a smooth, mirror-like finish without visible scratches. Period lapidaries did not have the benefit of precision equipment or fine, uniform abrasives, so that small scratches and slightly milky finishes are common in examples of period lapidary. When judging mastery of polishing technique, judges should consider the nature of the technique and polishing equipment used; entries using both modern equipment and abrasives should be judged according to a modern standard, while entries using either period equipment or period abrasives should be judged according to the standards for the appropriate period.\n\rAbout Materials\n\rWhile use of natural materials is encouraged, extreme cost and tightly controlled distribution of certain types of natural gem rough may make their use in entries impossible. In these cases, synthetic stones are preferred, followed then by simulated stones. Synthetic gem rough is defined as a material that is effectively identical in chemical formulation to the natural gem. It has the same optical and physical properties, is just as hard to shape and polish, but was grown in a lab. Synthetic gem rough will be considered a fully authentic, period material for the purposes of judging.\n\rScoring Qualifiers\n\rSimulated gem rough is defined as lab-created material which is not chemically identical to the natural gemstone, and does not necessarily have the same physical or optical properties. Although simulated gem rough is not an authentic material, entries made from it should only be penalized .5 point for Methods and Materials. The hardness portion of the Scope score should be based on the hardness of the simulant, not the natural stone. Cubic zirconium (CZ) is slightly less hard than corundum, but still much harder than garnet, and substantially harder than quartz. Yttrium aluminate (YAG), a garnet simulant, is slightly harder than garnet. A stone cut from YAG will score .5 point lower in Methods and Materials than an identical stone cut from natural garnet, but will score .5 point higher in hardness for Scope.")

Drawings of the artisan's intent (or photographs of a period piece), if included, will help to show the original intent and compare it to the execution. For scores in Documentation and Methods and Materials, consideration can be given to entries that may logically have existed either as a derivative (e.g., from a wood or cloth item) or there is evidence of similar articles before and after the time of the article, so it is logical that the piece existed in some form within period.

# I honestly suggest that it might be best if possible to remove any of the existing items in the CriteriaType, CriteriaDescription, Criterium, and ApplicableCriterium sections, if anything.
# I believe the below will populate ALL of that correctly from scratch.  I realize you can't remove the categories since people have registered projects with them, so I've included code to
# update those instead.  But for everything else it would be better to start from scratch if possible...I know there wasn't much in there for the items in question so I'm hoping that's easy.

Does the eye flow easily from one part of the piece to another without 'falling off the page'? Is your eye drawn to the important elements? Is there a border? Is the piece balanced?\n\rFigure work - The human figure, animals or mythical creatures.\n\rDrapery - Primarily clothing, this also refers to any fabric/other element which is 'draped' over another form. Of particular importance is the ability to recognize the object underneath the drape.\n\rLine Quality - Are the lines smooth or rough (either is good, depending on the Supporting Evidence for this particular piece)? Are the lines formed consistently?\n\rSupport - The paper, canvas, or other surface that is drawn upon.\n\rGround - Any preparation to the support, gesso, wash etc.")

fiberpreparationforspinning.update(description: "The category is intended to cover the results from the activity of preparing fibers for spinning, not the activity of spinning itself. The demonstration of the preparation as an activity should be judged in the category Demonstrating Period Activities. Here the emphasis should be put on the prepared fibers, and how close they come to being \"ready to spin.\"")
glassworkblown.update(description: "This category includes all works made of glass objects that have been mouth-blown using molten glass as the base material. This may include objects such as bottles, drinking vessels, goblets, bowls, plates, or novelty objects that were created using this method.")
glassworklampworkbeads.update(description: "This category includes all lampwork beads, made on a torch or in a period furnace. Substitution of materials because of prohibitive cost or unsuitability should be explained in the Supporting Evidence and should not be counted against the entrant.")

herbcraftandapothecary.update(description: "This category encompasses all useful, pleasant, and comfortable preparations of herbs designed to comfort and cure. There are four broad subcategories which will be judged:\n\rCulinary: teas, seasonings, herb candies, preserves, etc.\n\rComfort and cosmetic: perfume, soaps, lotions, green salves, etc.\n\rOrnamental: dye stuffs, potpourri, pomanders, rose beads, etc.\n\rTinctures and distillates.\n\rHerbal preparations that are NOT eligible for entry include those used for magical, religious, or poisonous purposes, as well as those considered \"hard medicine\" (i.e., a poultice specifically recommended for curing boils, tinctures prescribed to prevent plague, etc.). Folk remedies or nutritious concoctions like drinks made for laboring mothers are still acceptable because they are meant as nutrition more than a treatment for pain.\n\rAny herbs and spices used in the entry must be listed in the Supporting Evidence with their Latin botanical names and must be in compliance with the Prohibited and Restricted Herbs list. This includes any item intended for ingestion and/or skin absorption. Points will not be deducted for substituting an ingredient for an item on this list as long as the substitution is noted in the Supporting Evidence.")
illumination.update(description: "This category includes decoration of fine handwriting done with pen on paper or other writing ground such as the decoration of text, page, or initial letters with ornamental designs, miniatures, or lettering. Simulated writing such as embroidery, etching, or inlaying on swords or chain mail rings should be entered under the other appropriate category.")
ironworking.update(description: "This category is for functional metalwork. Owing to the extreme difficulty in preparing iron and high-carbon steel from raw materials, judges should consider modern alloys as a conservative substitution for those available to our honorable ancestors in most cases.")
knittingnalbinding.update(description: "This category encompasses non-woven work done with thread or yarn and at least one needle.\n\rExamples include stockings, hats, shirts, gloves, and carpets. Nålbinding is a single-needle knitting technique known in Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Coptic cultures in period. \n\rUse of period materials encouraged, but if the entrant cannot use period materials or methods for allergy or other medical reasons and documents those reasons in the Supporting Evidence, he/she should not be penalized. If using a hand-spun, hand-dyed yarn, it does not need to be spun/dyed by the entrant.")

lacemaking.update(description: "This category includes network or lacis and needle laces such as reticella, punto in aria, rose point, gross point, bobbin lace, sprang, and woven laces. If using a hand-spun, hand-dyed yarn, it does not have to be spun/dyed by the entrant and no extra points will be given for this. Note: Here, needle lace denotes an embroidered, loop edging; cutwork denotes embroidery of cut-out shapes in fabric where the majority of the item is still the original fabric. Lacis can be embroidered over either a net made of knotted threads or a net made by drawing the threads out of a piece of linen.")
lapidary.update(description: "This category is for entries made from gemstones or crystals. Lapidary judges should keep in mind that primary sources for this category consist mainly of museum pieces and a few treatises, such as Albert Magnus and Theophilus.\n\rThe following techniques are typical to period stones and should be treated as examples of authentic methods when judging authenticity:\n\rPolished nicks in stones were the result of cutting out a flaw while removing as little material and weight as possible.\n\rStones which have been polished or faceted following the original shape so as to lose as little weight as possible.\n\rDrilled stones.\n\rCrystals, especially low-grade emeralds, drilled lengthwise and polished but not substantially shaped.\n\rCabochons which started out as drilled stones, then were cut in half, leaving a line across the back of the stone where the hole was.\n\rModern standards for gemstone polish require a smooth, mirror-like finish without visible scratches. Period lapidaries did not have the benefit of precision equipment or fine, uniform abrasives, so that small scratches and slightly milky finishes are common in examples of period lapidary. When judging mastery of polishing technique, judges should consider the nature of the technique and polishing equipment used; entries using both modern equipment and abrasives should be judged according to a modern standard, while entries using either period equipment or period abrasives should be judged according to the standards for the appropriate period.\n\rAbout Materials\n\rWhile use of natural materials is encouraged, extreme cost and tightly controlled distribution of certain types of natural gem rough may make their use in entries impossible. In these cases, synthetic stones are preferred, followed then by simulated stones. Synthetic gem rough is defined as a material that is effectively identical in chemical formulation to the natural gem. It has the same optical and physical properties, is just as hard to shape and polish, but was grown in a lab. Synthetic gem rough will be considered a fully authentic, period material for the purposes of judging.\n\rScoring Qualifiers\n\rSimulated gem rough is defined as lab-created material which is not chemically identical to the natural gemstone, and does not necessarily have the same physical or optical properties. Although simulated gem rough is not an authentic material, entries made from it should only be penalized .5 point for Methods and Materials. The hardness portion of the Scope score should be based on the hardness of the simulant, not the natural stone. Cubic zirconium (CZ) is slightly less hard than corundum, but still much harder than garnet, and substantially harder than quartz. Yttrium aluminate (YAG), a garnet simulant, is slightly harder than garnet. A stone cut from YAG will score .5 point lower in Methods and Materials than an identical stone cut from natural garnet, but will score .5 point higher in hardness for Scope.")
leatherwork.update(description: "This category is for entries created out of the tanned hide of any animal. Such entries include garments, bottles, book covers, armor pieces, and multiple piece items such as furniture. Created substitutes for prohibitively expensive or illegal materials should not be penalized if they are noted in the Supporting Evidence.\n\rSupporting Evidence for this category should include visual sources and/or extant artifacts to aid in confirming the intent, creativity, and success of an entry. Drawings of the artisan's intent (or photographs of a period piece), if included, will help to show the original intent and compare it to the execution. For scores in Supporting Evidence and Methods and Materials, consideration can be given to entries that may logically have existed either as a derivative (e.g., from a wood or cloth item) or there is evidence of similar articles before and after the time of the article, so it is logical that the piece existed in some form within period. Must be shown in the Supporting Evidence.")

papermaking.update(description: "This category is for papers made from any variety of period materials. A minimum of three sheets of paper constitute an entry, although more than 3 sheets is acceptable. Supporting Evidence should include information on national and/or regional characteristics of the entry, the intended use of the paper, and the rationale for production choices as they affect the potential use.")
physicalperformance.update(description: "This category is for performances that primarily involve physical movement (other than dance), including acrobatics, balancing, juggling, miming, mummering, sleight of hand, tumbling, stilt-walking, magic, plate-spinning, and any other similar art. Performers may do one or more different kinds of movement (e.g. juggling and tumbling). Interpretation should be done with period materials and likely scenarios. The tradition drawn on may be European, Middle Eastern, East Asian, Slavic, or from another culture that had documentable contact with Western Europe before 1600 C.E. The performance may by a group or an individual. Groups will be evaluated as a single ensemble unless one or more entrants wish to be judged as individuals; in this case, individual entrants will register for the competition as separate entries and remind the judges that they are to be scored individually. Individual entrants will be judged on their own performances only; any other performer is not scored, except as it directly impacts the entrant's performance. Performances that involve potentially dangerous materials, such as fire, should be prepared to perform outdoors. Any entry that exhibits danger to the entrant(s), animal performers, judges, or audience will be immediately disqualified. Live performances may be no longer than 15 minutes. Performers may present excerpts or abridgements of a longer routine in order to comply with this time limit. Entrants who require space or equipment not available or usable at the event site should provide a video of the performance, plus equipment with which to play the recording without internet. The performance must be no longer than 15 minutes; for longer videos, the entrant must clearly indicate in the Supporting Evidence which 15 minutes of the performance the judges should examine. Judged material need not be contiguous and may include up to five segments, as needed.")
research.update(description: "This is a mail-in category. Check the current rules on the A&S Faire website or the Middle Kingdom newsletter, The Pale, for the deadline. No late entries will be accepted. THE KMOAS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU EMAIL YOUR ENTRY. Post-mail entries are accepted if they are postmarked by the deadline, but will be scanned in and delivered via email to judges. This category is eligible for Regional Faires.\n\rSpecial rules: This category has several special rules which need to be reviewed carefully.\n\rThe entry must be a research paper written in an acceptable format for a term paper or thesis. Research notes written in an attractive style or a newspaper article are not acceptable. Entrants in this category should consult a current term paper or thesis stylebook (i.e., APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) before creating an entry.\n\rAny evidence of plagiarism disqualifies the entry from the fair and the entry will be referred to the KMOAS.\n\rLength Limit: 30 double-spaced typed pages, not including illustrations, title page, and any appendices.\n\rAny paper having more than one author must be entered by all the people involved in its writing.")
scientificdevices.update(description: "This category is for items created to measure, teach, or explain the workings of the world or demonstrate a philosophy. The period concept of \"science\" was very different from the modern meaning. Instruments for the study of the natural world were less \"scientific equipment\" than \"philosophical devices\", designed to demonstrate a principle or natural law. Examples may include measuring devices such as an astrolabe or carpentry tools, charts such as cutting or footwork charts from combat manuals, maps, mathematical tables, survey equipment, etc. Items entered should be functional and usable.")
sculpture.update(description: "This category includes three-dimensional entries sculpted or carved from metal, wood, clay, stone, or other period-appropriate material varying from religious bestiaries, Celtic entwining, relief panels, Christian church art, runestones, etc. Traditionally, these items would be considered decorative in nature, rather than for functional use.")
siegeengines.update(description: "This category includes working scale models of siege engines that will throw projectiles via torsion, falling or shifting weight, human muscle powers, or other such power sources. Items related to sieges that do not function as offensive projectile weapons, those involving black powder or other incendiary material, and non-functioning replicas of siege weapons are not eligible for this category.\n\rThe scale of the engine and the weight of the object to be thrown must be noted in the Supporting Evidence. The performance of the entry will be measured by its ability to throw a projectile a reasonable distance with good precision, and then the entrant should be prepared to provide data on the performance of the type of engine they are modeling as well as performance data for their model.")
skeletalmaterials.update(description: "This category is for entries created out of bone, antler, or horn, such as bone or horn corset stays, needles, pins, buttons, beads, and multiple piece items such as reliquaries, diptychs, and polytychs. Consideration must be given to the legality of owning certain materials, such as new elephant ivory or whalebone/teeth. Natural substitutes for ivory and whalebone such as bone, tagua nuts, antler, or animal teeth should not be penalized. The use of plastic, polysaturated linen, or other synthetic ivory substitutes is acceptable if a particular piece could not be made out of a natural substitute. Shell and coral may be included in this category or the Division 4, Sculpture category depending on the nature of the entry.\n\rCaution: The dust produced from the creation of items out of skeletal materials is unhealthy if inhaled so entrants are advised to wear the proper respiratory masks when working. The dust is also abrasive. Eye protection should be worn when working with skeletal materials.")
spinning.update(description: "This category includes all-natural fiber threads produced by spinning on a drop spindle, supported spindle, great wheel, or flyer and bobbin wheel. The category also includes plying of threads, if threads are meant to be plyed.\n\rSupporting Evidence should include discussion of the intended use of the entry. The entrant should expect that the entry skein will be unwound by the judges to closely examine the thread. It will also be tested for strength.")
spokenperformanceperiodstyle.update(description: "This category is for all spoken-word performances, poetry or prose, recited or improvised. Pieces performed may be period (pre-17th c.) or in a period style, either from Europe or any culture that had documentable contact with Europe before 1600 C.E. Pieces from after 1600 C.E. must be period in style, such as those that would score highly as an entry in the Literary Composition categories. Dramatized performances (i.e., performances where actors take the roles of characters, with blocking, costuming, props, etc.); should be entered in the Dramatic Performance category. The performance may be by a group or an individual. Groups of performers will be evaluated as a single ensemble unless one or more entrants wish to be judged as individuals; in this case, individual entrants will register for the competition as separate entries and will remind the judges that they are to be scored individually. Individual entrants will be judged on their own performances only; any other performer is not scored, except as it directly impacts the entrant's performance. Performances that involve potentially dangerous materials, such as fire, should be prepared to perform outdoors. Any entry that exhibits danger to the entrant(s), judges, or audience will be immediately disqualified. The performance may be no longer than 15 minutes. Performers may present excerpts or abridgements of a longer work in order to comply with this time limit.")
spokenperformancepostperiodstyle.update(description: "This category is for performances of post-SCA-period spoken pieces, such as SCA culture-style pieces, pre-17th-c. works performed in a manner reminiscent of a later time period, and 17th- to 21st-c. works from cultures without extant notated music from SCA period. Pieces must be relevant to the SCA and/or the study of medieval and Renaissance Europe. An entry's relevance may be signified by its ability to recreate conjectured historical music, document SCA history, create a period-feeling audience experience, and build SCA community, among other considerations. Entrants must explain the piece's relevance if it is not obvious. Newly written works in a faithfully pre-17th-c. historical style should be entered in the Spoken Performance: Period Style category. Dramatized performances (with characters, blocking, costuming, props, etc.); should be entered in the Dramatic Performance category. The performance may be by a group or an individual. Groups will be evaluated as a single ensemble unless one or more entrants wish to be judged as individuals; if so, individual will register for the competition as separate entries and remind the judges that they are to be scored individually. Individual entrants will be judged on their own performances only; any other performer is not scored, except as it directly impacts the entrant's performance. Performances that involve potentially dangerous materials, such as fire, should be prepared to perform outdoors. Any entry that exhibits danger to anyone involved will be immediately disqualified. The performance may be no longer than 15 minutes. Performers may present excerpts or abridgements of a longer work in order to comply with this time limit.")
toolmaking.update(description: "This category is for tools and equipment used by artisans. Because of the diverse nature of these items, some entries may be better suited in other categories (e.g. measuring tools might be better entered in the Scientific Instruments category).")
toymaking.update(description: "The category includes items created specifically for use as children's toys, such as dolls, human or animal figurines, miniature household wares and weapons, hobby horses, and moving toys (whirligigs, hoops). It does NOT include game boards, table games, or items associated with adult amusements, such as gambling or gaming. Since nearly any object can become a toy if the child is sufficiently bored or imaginative, entries in this category should be restricted to purpose-made toys, whether commercially produced or homemade. \n\rNOTE: Modern notions of child safety in toys do not appear to have been concerns in period toys, so materials or designs which would be dangerous for children may be used at the entrant's discretion and at their own risk. Use of materials that are potentially toxic by skin absorption (leaded pewter, hazardous mineral pigments in decorations) should NOT be used. A safe substitution should be noted the Supporting Evidence. Additionally, miniature firearms or edged weapons must conform to SCA rules for such items, regardless of period use.")
weaponmaking.update(description: "This category includes all weapons made from wood or metal, such as swords, spears, rapiers, daggers, bows, crossbows, arrows, etc. Post-period weapon types will not be considered. The following additional rules will be relied upon when judging this category:\n\rBlades are not required to be sharpened and points should not be withheld nor awarded for sharpness.\n\rNo points should be deducted for a light coating of oil on the metal of a weapon as a preservative. If documented, authentic preservatives should be looked upon favorably.")
weavingloomcontrolled.update(description: "The category is for loom-controlled weaving using period-type looms. Entries that have been produced on Jacquard or computer looms are not eligible for entry. One yard of woven material at least 15 inches wide is adequate for an entry in this category. The category does not include tablet, warp-weighted, inkle, or card weaving. See the other weaving categories for the best fit for an entry.")
weavingtablet.update(description: "This category is for textiles produced using tablet or card weaving. The entrant must specify the tablet-weaving technique used to produce the entry and the planned use of the entry in the Supporting Evidence. The use of synthetic gold or silver thread will be considered an acceptable alternative for real gold or silver thread and will not be penalized.")
weavingtapestriesrugs.update(description: "The category is for tapestry weaving using period-type looms. The types of looms include (but are not limited to) backstrap, frame, frame and treadle, rigid heddle, and warp-weighted. Entries that have been produced on Jacquard or computer looms are not eligible for entry. The category does not include cloth, tablet, or card weaving; nor weaver-manipulated weaves. Please see the other weaving categories to determine the best fit for an entry. Note: Purchased tapestry/rug materials are acceptable in this category. If using a hand-spun and/or hand-dyed yarn, no extra points will be given.")
weavingwarpweightedloom.update(description: "The category is for weaving created on warp-weighted looms. Items that include tablet or card weaving as a part of the entry may be entered here, so long as they are part of a larger piece of weaving and do not dominate the entry.")
weavingweavermanipulated.update(description: "The category is for finger-/weaver-manipulated weaving using period-type looms. The types of looms include (but are not limited to) backstrap, dobby draw, frame, frame and treadle, inkle and rigid heddle. One yard of woven material is adequate to demonstrate technique and consistency for a project. Entries that have been produced on Jacquard or computer looms are not eligible for entry. The category does not include tablet or card weaving. Please see the other weaving categories to determine the best fit for an entry.")
woodconstructionandjoinery.update(description: "This category is for the construction and joinery of wooden objects, not their decoration or embellishment. As availability of lumber types in the Middle Kingdom does not match those available to our honorable ancestors, it is likely that the entrant will have to make substitutions and it will be incumbent upon them to explain these choices. Any unusual techniques or materials should be explained in the Supporting Evidence. Hardware used does not need to be made by the entrant. Because the expectations of our Society differ from those of our honorable ancestors, entrants should not be unduly penalized for changes made for reasons of water resistance or transportability, but these decisions should be explained in the Supporting Evidence.")
woodembellishment.update(description: "This category is for the decoration and embellishment of wooden items, not their construction, and covers techniques such as inlay, veneer, marquetry, incised carving, low-relief carving, chip carving, burned decoration, gesso and modeled gesso, metal foils, turnings, etc. As availability of lumber types in the Middle Kingdom does not match those available to our honorable ancestors, it is likely that the entrant will have to make substitutions and it will be incumbent upon them to explain these choices. Any unusual techniques or materials should be explained in the Supporting Evidence.")
woodturning.update(description: "This category is for wooden items turned on a lathe. As availability of lumber types in the Middle Kingdom does not match those available to our honorable ancestors, it is likely that the entrant will have to make substitutions and it will be incumbent upon them to explain these choices. Any unusual techniques or materials should be explained in the Supporting Evidence.")
